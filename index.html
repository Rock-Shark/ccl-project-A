                <p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">Discovered by: Angelica Sha</p>
                <p style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">Location: Discarded drafts</p>

                <h3 class="bred">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The mycelium is composed of reddish-brown circular stacks that continuously contract to facilitate
                    breathing.</p>
                <p> When it detects nearby mycelia, it extends branches to connect and integrate with one another,
                    forming a cohesive communicative network.</p>
                <p> When reaching a considerate number, the pattern of the branches and myceliums resembles a tree laden
                    with fruit, which is how it got its name.</p>

                <p>Discarded drafts filled with abandoned ideas or inspirations. </p>
                <p>The mold thrives on those neglected artistic thoughts.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Where there's abandoned thoughts, there's AST.</li>
                    <li>Thrives on inspirations.</li>
                    <li>Uses branches to communicate.</li>
                    <li>Can find other AST molds however far they are.</li>
                    <li>Multiplies when there's new thoughts.</li>
                    <li>Not poisonous but not delicious either.</li>

            <p>
                It's known to all that humans are constantly forgetting thoughts. This raises a profound question
                that has puzzled mankind for thousands of years: Where do these forgotten thoughts go? Thanks to the
                groundbreaking discovery by Dr. Sha, I am delighted to introduce to you the very organism that feeds
                on our discarded thoughts: ASTree Mold. This microorganism thrives wherever forgotten ideas
                gather—whether
                in drafts, memos, notebooks, or even diaries. The mold’s color and shape subtly change depending on the
                thoughts it is currently feeding on. Furthermore, a special method is required to see this elusive
                creature
                , so no wonder humans have ignored our closest friend for such a long time: Our world would be filled
                with unused thoughts without these helpful decomposers！

            <p class="red">[!!TRY TO PRESS YOUR MOUSE OUTSIDE THE CANVAS!!]</p>
            <p>Press your mouse anywhere to attract another Nian-Nian-Mold and see how these two molds communicate.</p>
            <p>You can try drawing your own patterns (or even creating your own art!) on the canvas.</p>
            <p>However, which mold the new-born mold chooses to communicate is randomly generated. Be patient and be
                nice to them.</p>
